Hi, I'm Luke ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in the UK with over a decade of experience building software. I specialise in frontend development, working mainly with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Node**.

While my main focus is on frontend work, I have experience with backend development and enjoy contributing to full-stack projects.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me swimming, running, skiing, or enjoying some time gaming.
